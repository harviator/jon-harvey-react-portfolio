## Description

We were tasked with updating our HTML portfolios into React apps.  The portfolio offers us a place to showcase our work to potential employers and developers.  However, we don't have a back-end on this app, so some functionality is lost.


## Motivation

Helps us to get familiar with React as well as cleanly render a multiple page site as a single page.  It also sets us apart from other developers by using one of the latest technologies for our portfolio.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Technologies

* HTML, Bootstrap, & CSS
* JavaScript
* React

## Process

* For this project we were given some starter code.
* Based on the start code I created the db.js to work with IndexedDB to store data offline and pass that data into the database once online, then using a service worker and manifest to store files to render the website in the cache.
* The biggest challenges for this project I had was getting the service worker to function properly.
* The successes for this project was getting a better getting more exposure to working with IndexedDB, service worker, and manifest file to create a PWA.
* Credit to my tutor, TA's, and classmates for their help.
